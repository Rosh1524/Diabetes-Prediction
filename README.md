# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on health data such as age, gender, BMI, blood glucose levels, and smoking history. It uses algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. The model processes inputs through encoding and scaling techniques, making it easy for users to get quick predictions: "Diabetic" or "Not Diabetic." This tool is aimed at helping individuals assess their diabetes risk.

Features: Real-time Prediction: Users can input their data and get a prediction about their diabetes risk. Multiple Models: The project uses models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM to predict outcomes. Data Preprocessing: Handles encoding of categorical variables and scaling of numerical features.

Technologies Used: Python Scikit-Learn (for Machine Learning) Pandas (for data manipulation) Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

Dataset: The dataset includes the following features: Gender, Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Smoking History, BMI, HbA1c Level, Blood Glucose Level.

How to Use: Provide input data in the format:Gender, Age, Hypertension (0 or 1), Heart Disease (0 or 1), Smoking History, BMI, HbA1c Level, Blood Glucose Level The model will output a prediction: Diabetic or Not Diabetic.
